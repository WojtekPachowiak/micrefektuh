super crazy library for applying real-time audio effects over microphone input

### STATUS
- switching from Python to Rust for speed
- planning to implement guitar pedals and other audio effects. While modifying single input numbers is easy, I don't know how the effects requiring some buffer (ex. Delay) should be implemented.
